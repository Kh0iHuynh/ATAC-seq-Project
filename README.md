# **ATAC-seq Project:**

## Raw sequence data processing. 

The main script is bamprocess.sh. It generate bed files and corrected bam files from fastq 

## Peak calling:

The main script is peakcalling.sh. It calls for regions which have the highest read density compared to background reads density. Within these regions, the highest read density locus is the peak summit.

## Peak merging and averaging:

The main script is averagepeak.sh. This script takes in all peak files called for each tissues (4 tissues total). Then, it process the script accodring to the averaging method in the paper. 

## Euchromatin peak filter and peak annotation: 

The main script is peakannotation.sh. It is used to annotated the peaks that are filtered using the euchromatin boundaries described in the paper. 

## Peak quality control plot:

The main script is peakqualityplot.r. The script will output all of the peak quality control plots in the paper. The inputs for the script are generated by peakqualitydatageneration.sh

## Normalization for differences between genotypes and tissues for all samples:
